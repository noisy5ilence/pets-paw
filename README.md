This is a [PetsPaw](https://noisysilence-pets-paw.vercel.app) project implemented with [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org/), [`ReactQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/), [`Axios`](https://axios-http.com/) and [`The Cat API`](https://thecatapi.com/)

You can run it [`locally`](http://localhost:3000) (you have to set environment variables [`NEXT_PUBLIC_PETS_PAW_BASE=localhost:3000`]) or play with deployed [`demo`](https://pets-paw-paw.vercel.app/)
